Components and Pages:

- PascalCase, for example `HomeScreen`
- have to be typed Function Components (FC<Props>) (see ExampleComponent.tsx)
- Props have to be typed at the top of the file (see ExampleComponent.tsx)
- Props should always have a prop object, not a deconstructor ((props: Props)=>{})
- Avoid UseEffects whenever possible

Functions:

- Functions are camelCase, for example `function testFunction()`
- Always declare return types

### Branch Naming Conventions:

Branch name should always start with `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/` or `refactor/`, continued with the content of the branch. For example: `feature/microphone-impl`
